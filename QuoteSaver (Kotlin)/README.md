# Overview

I wrote this program with the intent to learn and demonstrate the Kotlin language and become more familiar with developing programs using classes and objects.

Quote Saver is an application that you can use to store quotes or sayings that are meaningful to you or you would like to remember. It has a feature that allows you to search for quotes by words, source, or a keyword. Further features allow you to edit and delete individual quotes. A keyword feature allows you to organize your quotes

# Development Environment

I used Intellij IDEA Community Eidition with the Kotlin language. I took an object-oriented approach to the program to gain more experience using classes and objects. I used two Java libraries java.io and java.time. These libraries were used to handle the reading and writing of the file and creating a date object for each quote.
